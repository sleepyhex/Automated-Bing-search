# Rewards Search Automator

> ⚙️ Educational browser automation & UI interaction project  
> 🧪 Built for learning automation concepts, not for abuse

## 📌 Overview

**Rewards Search Automator** is a Python-based **UI automation learning project** that demonstrates how automated scripts can interact with web browsers to simulate user search behavior.

It is **not intended** to bypass safeguards, abuse reward systems, or violate any platform’s Terms of Service.

## ✨ Features

- Choose which browser to launch
- Configure number of automated searches
- Load search queries from a text file
- Randomized delays between actions
- Keyboard-focused navigation (no hard dependency on mouse clicks)
- Modular structure for easy extension
- Simple and beginner-friendly Python code

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Windows OS
- Installed web browser (Chrome, Brave, Edge, etc.)

Python dependency: pyautogui

Install with: pip install pyautogui

## 🚀 How It Works (High-Level)

1. Loads search queries from a text file
2. Randomizes the order
3. Opens a selected browser
4. Navigates to a search engine
5. Simulates typing and submitting search queries
6. Waits between actions to demonstrate timing control

This approach intentionally uses **UI automation** instead of APIs to highlight:
- why UI automation is fragile
- why real-world testing tools avoid pixel-based logic
- how timing and focus affect automation reliability
